[![master](https://github.com/vv9k/wutag/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vv9k/wutag/actions/workflows/master.yml)
A command line tool for tagging files

## Fork
#### New directory locations
* [x] `macOS` now uses the following locations:
    * [x] `$HOME/.cache` instead of `$HOME/Library/Caches` for `wutag.registry`
    * [x] `$HOME/.config` instead of `$HOME/Library/Application Support` for `wutag.yml`

#### Global option
* [x] `list`, `rm`, `clear`, and `search` have `--global` option to match only on files that are already tagged
    * `wutag -g rm '**/z*.md' flag_name`
* [x] `list [FLAGS] (files|tags) [OPTS]` is local by default. Use `-g|--global` to view all tagged files

#### Display and formatting
* [x] `list files -t` does not display full path of files unless `-g|--global` is used. Instead it is directory-relative
* [x] `list files -tG` displays `tags` and `files` on separate lines (`--garrulous` is taken from [`tag`](https://github.com/jdbery/tag))
* [x] `list tags` displays the count of each tag
* [x] `list files -tf` displays `tags` and `files` in a column `-f`ormat (requires `-t|--with-tags`)
* [x] Display a success message of which registry is cleaned when clearing cache with `clean-cache`

#### Improved globbing
* [x] Case insensitive globbing applies to any pattern, as well as the `-g|--global` option
* [x] Both `--global` and non-`global` options have extended features
    * [`globwalk`](https://github.com/Gilnaa/globwalk) for non-`global`
    * [`globset`](https://docs.rs/globset/0.4.8/globset/#syntax) for `--global`
        * This has more features than the above
        * Only applies to `rm` and `clear` commands when using `--global`
* [ ] Am looking for a crate with good extended globbing
    * [`globber`](https://docs.rs/globber/0.1.3/globber/index.html#syntax) has more features, but doesn't support case-insensitivity

#### Multiple registries
* [x] Multiple registries are available with the `-r|--registry` option
* [ ] FIXME: Error if setting a tag to name `registry` if unquoted
    * (Maybe) Add registry to `ERROR` message (would be difficult to implement, have to use registry in the metadata)
    * Registries can also be used through the `WUTAG_REGISTRY` environment variable
    * Tildes (`~`), and other environment variables can be used when declaring the registry:
```sh
`WUTAG_REGISTRY="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wutag/my.registry wutag set '*.rs' rust"`
```

* [x] `wutag` respects the `NO_COLOR` environment variable when displaying output (that is `export NO_COLOR=1`)

#### Default command
* [x] Use `wutag list files -t` as a default command if there are none listed (i.e., using only `wutag`)
    * Trying to decide whether or not local or global should be default

#### Aliases and subcommand inferencing
* [x] Alias `list` with `ls` and infer all other subcommands, i.e., `clean` == `clean-cache`; `p`, `pr`, `pri` ... == `print-completions`
    * As long as the command can be clearly inferred with no ambiguity

#### New command similar to what `add` vs `set` would be
* [x] Differentiate between `set` and `add` (added `wutag set --clear`)
    * May instead use `add` and `set` at some point
    * For the time being, `set --clear` will `clear` the tags before setting it

#### Completions
* [x] List tags and use them for completions
    * Improves completion capabilities
    * When using any command that requires an existing tag, pressing `<tab>` will autocomplete
    * `clap::ValueHints` is also used to complete paths and files

#### Todo
* [ ] Find way to force colored output on pipe
* [ ] Configuration option for base file color
* [ ] Fix `any` vs the normal `all` (it doesn't work)
* [ ] `raw` does not work with formatted (fix or find way to implement `conflicts_with`)

![Example usage](https://github.com/vv9k/wutag/blob/master/static/usage.svg)

## Install

If you use arch Linux and have AUR repositories set up you can use your favourite AUR manager to download `wutag`. For example with `paru`:
 - `paru -S wutag`
 - or latest master branch with `paru -S wutag-git`

If you're on another Linux distribution or MacOS you can download one of the prebuilt binaries from [here](https://github.com/vv9k/wutag/releases).

To build manually you'll need latest `rust` and `cargo`. Build with:
 - `cargo build --release`

## Usage

By default each tag will be assigned with a random color from 8 base colors (either bright or normal so 16 colors in total). You can later edit each tag by using `edit` subcommand like this:
 - `wutag edit school --color 0x1f1f1f`
 - or `wutag edit code --color '#ff00aa'`
 - or `wutag edit work --color FF0000`
 - The colors are case insensitive

Each command that takes a pattern starts a filesystem traversal from current working directory. To override this
behaviour specify a global parameter `--dir` or `-d` like this:
 - `wutag -d ~ set '**' code`

Default recursion depth is set to *2*. To increase it use `--max-depth` or `-m` global parameter.

After tagging your files with `set` like:
 - `wutag set '*.jpg' photos`
 - `wutag set 'DCIM_12*' doge`
you can easily get the list of files with specified tags by doing `wutag search photos doge`.

To utilize the list by other programs pass the `--raw` or `-r` flag to `search` subcommand like:
 - `wutag search -r --any cat doge | xargs rm -rf  # please don't do this :(`.

When `--any` flag is provided as in the example `wutag` will match files containing any of the provided tags rather than all of them.

If you are into emojis then surely you can use emojis to tag files üôÇ ```wutag set '*.doc' üìã```

## Configuration

`wutag` lets you configure base colors used when creating tags or modify other settings globally.
There will be a `wutag.yml` file located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wutag` or `$HOME/.config/wutag` with only `max_depth` in it. Colors can be added like so:

Example configuration:
```yaml
---
max_depth: 100
colors:
- '0xabba0f'
- '#121212'
- '0x111111'
```

## Tab completion

To get tab completion use `wutag print-completions --shell <shell> > /path/to/completions/dir/...` to enable it in your favorite shell.

Available shells are:
 - `bash`
 - `elvish`
 - `fish`
 - `powershell`
 - `zsh`

 To enable completions on the fly use:
 - `. <(wutag print-completions --shell zsh)`

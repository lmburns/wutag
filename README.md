# wutag üî±üè∑Ô∏è 

Multi platform tool for tagging and organizing files by tags.

![Example usage](https://github.com/wojciechkepka/wutag/blob/master/static/usage.svg)

## Disclaimer

This tool uses so called extra attributes also known as *xattrs* to store metadata and so it might not work on certain filesystems. A thing to keep in mind is that most transfer tools require opt-in flag to transfer xattrs like `rsync` with option `-X`, `--xattrs` or `cp` with `--preserve=xattr`

Support for Windows will be added through NTFS data streams which offer access to extended attributes. I haven't yet tested if they can be preserved while transfering to other filesystems.

MacOS and Linux should work out of the box.

## Build
The build requires `rust` and `cargo`. To build run:
